# Functions - are like a little machine that do something
# Functions are reusable actions that have a name
# To execute a function we use random_function()

# print() is a built in function!
# help("int") is an another built in function!

# Arguments are inputs we provide to a function.

word = "Chicken"
print(len(word))

# Another useful built in function is input()
first_name = input("What is your name?")
last_name = input("What is your last name?")
print("Hey there " + first_name + " " + last_name)
